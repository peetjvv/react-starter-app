# React Starter App

## Description

This is a lightweight starter React app without all the extra code that comes with `create-react-app`. I use this to spin up my personal projects. Feel free to fork/copy and start up an app of your own. This app has the following set up and ready to use out of the box:

- Webpack
- adding custom assets like images and favicon
- Typescript ready
- Sass
- linting with Prettier and ESLint (recommend adding the ESLint extension in VS Code)
- unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## Requirements

- node 16 (v18 might also work, but is untested)
- npm 8

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone / Download the repo
2. In your terminal, cd into the repo directory you just created
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to run the app locally
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
