# React Starter App

## Description

This is a simple Typescript starter React app without all the extra code that comes with `create-react-app`. Feel free to fork/copy and start up an app of your own. This app has the settings for webpack 5, images, favicon, typescript and sass already set up.

## Requirements

- node 14 (newer versions might work, but are untested)
- npm 6 or 7 (tested on npm 7)

## Getting started

1. Fork and clone / Download the repo
2. In your terminal, cd into the repo directory you just created
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to run the app locally
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
